Sure, I'll create a detailed flowchart diagram based on the decision-making process you provided. Here's the textual flow of the steps, which we will then convert into a diagram.

### Textual Flow
1. **Start**
2. **Have you explicitly set the PVC retention policy in the StatefulSet spec to whenDeleted: Retain?**
   - **Yes**:
     - **Delete the StatefulSet and keep the PVC and PV**.
   - **No**:
     - **First, delete the StatefulSet. Next, you will have to manually delete the PVC**.
3. **Is the PV reclaim policy set?**
   - **No**:
     - **Then you will have to delete the PV manually**.
     - **Next, delete the storage from the cloud provider using cloud portal or CLI**.
4. **When PVC is deleted, the bound PV along with the underlying storage volume will be deleted automatically**.
5. **End**

### Diagram Creation Instructions

To create this flowchart using draw.io or any other diagram tool, follow these steps:

1. **Start with an oval shape**:
   - Label: "Start"

2. **Add a diamond shape** for the first decision:
   - Label: "Have you explicitly set the PVC retention policy in the StatefulSet spec to whenDeleted: Retain?"

3. **Add two arrows** from the diamond:
   - One arrow labeled "Yes" pointing to a rectangle labeled "Delete the StatefulSet and keep the PVC and PV".
   - One arrow labeled "No" pointing to a rectangle labeled "First, delete the StatefulSet. Next, you will have to manually delete the PVC".

4. **From the "No" path rectangle**, add another decision diamond:
   - Label: "Is the PV reclaim policy set?"

5. **Add two arrows** from this second diamond:
   - One arrow labeled "No" pointing to a rectangle labeled "Then you will have to delete the PV manually".
   - Connect this rectangle to another rectangle labeled "Next, delete the storage from the cloud provider using cloud portal or CLI".
   - Another arrow labeled "Yes" from the second diamond pointing to a rectangle labeled "When PVC is deleted, the bound PV along with the underlying storage volume will be deleted automatically".

6. **Add an oval shape** for the end node:
   - Label: "End"

# Kubernetes 1.27: StatefulSet PVC Auto-Deletion Policy

This documentation covers the StatefulSet PVC Auto-Deletion policy introduced in Kubernetes 1.27.

## Overview

Kubernetes v1.27 introduced a beta policy mechanism for StatefulSets that controls the lifetime of their PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs). This policy allows users to specify if the PVCs generated from the StatefulSet spec template should be automatically deleted or retained when the StatefulSet is deleted or when replicas in the StatefulSet are scaled down.

## Flowchart

Below is a flowchart illustrating the decision-making process for setting the PVC retention policy and handling the deletion of StatefulSets and PVCs.

Using these steps and the provided diagram, you should have a comprehensive flowchart for your StatefulSet PVC retention policy. If you need any more specific guidance or adjustments, feel free to ask!
