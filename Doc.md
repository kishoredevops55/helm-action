# Disaster Recovery Environment for AKS Cluster

## Introduction

Disaster recovery (DR) planning is essential for ensuring business continuity and minimizing downtime in case of unforeseen events affecting your AKS cluster. This document outlines the steps and best practices for setting up a disaster recovery environment for an AKS cluster.

## Goals

- Ensure data resilience and availability in case of disasters.
- Minimize downtime and impact on business operations.
- Provide a clear plan for recovering the AKS cluster in various scenarios.

## Strategy Overview

The disaster recovery strategy for the AKS cluster will involve the following key components:

1. **Backup and Restore**: Regularly backup critical data and configuration settings of the AKS cluster to an offsite location. Implement mechanisms for restoring data quickly in case of data loss or corruption.

2. **High Availability**: Design the AKS cluster architecture for high availability by distributing workloads across multiple availability zones or regions. This ensures that the cluster remains operational even if one zone or region becomes unavailable.

3. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect potential issues and failures in the AKS cluster proactively. Set up alerts for critical metrics such as resource utilization, cluster health, and network connectivity.

4. **Failover and Recovery**: Define clear procedures and automation scripts for failing over to the disaster recovery environment in case of a primary cluster failure. Test the failover process regularly to ensure its effectiveness.

5. **Testing and Validation**: Conduct regular disaster recovery drills and simulations to validate the effectiveness of the DR plan. Identify and address any gaps or weaknesses in the recovery process.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Backup and Restore

- Configure Azure Backup or third-party backup solutions to regularly backup AKS cluster resources, including configuration settings, application data, and persistent volumes.
- Define backup schedules and retention policies based on data retention requirements and compliance standards.
- Test backup and restore procedures periodically to ensure data integrity and recoverability.

### 2. High Availability

- Deploy the AKS cluster across multiple availability zones or regions to distribute workloads and improve fault tolerance.
- Utilize Azure Load Balancer or Azure Traffic Manager for load balancing and traffic distribution across multiple clusters or regions.
- Implement Azure Traffic Manager endpoints for failover routing in case of region-level failures.

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting

- Configure Azure Monitor or third-party monitoring tools to monitor the health and performance of the AKS cluster.
- Set up alerts for critical metrics such as CPU utilization, memory usage, pod health, and cluster availability.
- Define escalation procedures and notification channels for alerting key stakeholders in case of critical incidents.

### 4. Failover and Recovery

- Develop runbooks and automation scripts for executing failover procedures in case of primary cluster failure.
- Test failover scenarios regularly to ensure the reliability and efficiency of the recovery process.
- Document step-by-step instructions for recovering data and restoring services in the disaster recovery environment.

### 5. Testing and Validation

- Conduct periodic disaster recovery drills and simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of the DR plan.
- Document lessons learned and recommendations from each drill to improve the DR strategy.
- Update the DR plan and procedures based on feedback and insights gained from testing.

## Cluster Information

| Cluster Name | Namespace    | App Code   |
|--------------|--------------|------------|
| cluster-1    | production   | app-123    |
| cluster-2    | development  | app-456    |
| cluster-3    | staging      | app-789    |

## Conclusion

Implementing a robust disaster recovery environment for an AKS cluster is crucial for maintaining business continuity and mitigating the impact of unexpected events. By following the guidelines outlined in this document and continuously refining the DR strategy, organizations can ensure the resilience and availability of their AKS workloads.
