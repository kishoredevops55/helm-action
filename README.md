# Kubernetes 1.27: StatefulSet PVC Auto-Deletion

## Introduction
Kubernetes 1.27 introduced a new PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) retention policy for StatefulSets, providing greater control over the lifecycle of PVCs associated with StatefulSets. This feature, now in beta, addresses the need for automatic management of PVCs when StatefulSets are deleted or scaled down.

## Use Case
The new PVC retention policy offers flexibility with two key settings: `whenScaled` and `whenDeleted`.

### WhenScaled: Delete
- **Scenario:** PVCs are deleted when the StatefulSet is scaled down.
- **Example:** Applications where data is temporary or easily reconstructable.
- **Benefits:** Reduces storage costs, simplifies management.

### WhenDeleted: Retain
- **Scenario:** PVCs are retained when the StatefulSet is deleted.
- **Example:** Applications needing data retention for temporary maintenance.
- **Benefits:** Ensures data availability upon re-creation of StatefulSet.

## Cost Savings
Automating the deletion of unused PVCs can result in significant cost savings:

- **Avoiding Unnecessary Storage Costs:** PVCs that are no longer needed are automatically deleted, reducing storage expenses.
  - **Example Calculation:**
    - **Before Policy:** 100 PVCs, $10/month each.
    - **After Policy:** 50 PVCs, $5/month each.
    - **Monthly Savings:** $5.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Automating the lifecycle management of PVCs ensures that resources are used efficiently.

## Adoption and Best Practices
To adopt this new policy, follow these steps and best practices:

### Adoption Steps
- Ensure you are running Kubernetes 1.27 or later.
- Update your StatefulSet YAML files to include the new PVC retention policies.
- Thoroughly test the updated configurations in a staging environment.

### Best Practices
- **Regular Backups and Monitoring:** Always have a backup plan and monitor the state of your PVCs and StatefulSets.
- **Implement Proper Alerting:** Set up alerts for changes in StatefulSet and PVC states to quickly address any issues.
- **Review and Optimize:** Periodically review your PVC retention policies and optimize them based on your workload needs.

## Example YAML Configuration
Hereâ€™s an example of how to configure a StatefulSet with the new PVC retention policy:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: example-statefulset
spec:
  serviceName: "example"
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: example-container
        image: example-image
        volumeMounts:
        - name: example-volume
          mountPath: /usr/share/example
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: example-volume
    spec:
      accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
  persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy:
    whenDeleted: Retain
    whenScaled: Delete
